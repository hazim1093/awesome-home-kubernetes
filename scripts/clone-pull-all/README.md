# Clone/Pull all projects

A simple hacky script to clone and/or pull all projects (github links) mentioned in the [Readme](../../README.md)

Helpful when you need to search something across all projects for inspiration :)

The projects are cloned in directories named: `<user>_<repository-name>` e.g `ams0_rancher-home`

## Usage
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python clone-pull-all.py -d /path/to/clone/in
```
